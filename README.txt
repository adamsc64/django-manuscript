django-manuscript
-----------------

A reusable Django application for managing scanned images of physical documents (such as manuscripts or reprints of manuscripts), displaying OCR text, and implementing an out of the box basic search functionality. This is itself intended to be an out-of-the-box Django application to help an institution manage a book digitization project.

This project is under development. Consider this project in alpha phase, in that there may be non-backwards compatible changes that come in version releases, for the moment. I'll put a notification up here when it becomes more stable.
