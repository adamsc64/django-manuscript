django-manuscript
-----------------

A reusable Django application for managing scanned images of physical documents (such as manuscripts or reprints of manuscripts), displaying OCR text, and out of the box basic search functionality. This is an out of the box application to help an institution manage a book digitization project.

This project is under development. I'm going to tag this repository with version numbers starting at 0.3 and submit distributions to the Python Package Index (PyPI) starting in a few weeks. Consider this project in alpha development stage, in that there may be non-backwards compatible changes for the moment. I'll put a notification up here when it becomes more stable.
