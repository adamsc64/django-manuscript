django-manuscript
-----------------

A reusable Django application for managing scanned images of physical documents, OCR text from scans, and basic search functionality digitization of manuscripts, geared toward non-profit and educational institutions.

This project is under development. I'm going to submit an official alpha version to the Python Package Index (PyPI) in a few weeks.
