- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -
-----------------------

John Wyclif (1324 -1384) has been variously described as “the morning star of the Reformation” and as a preacher of “lying insanities in the ears of many.” In his time, he was both England’s most eminent theologian and its first heresiarch. His commitment to the reform of the 14th-century church and to the enterprise of vernacular theology contributed to nearly a century of religious dissent in late medieval England and to England’s first popular heretical movement, known as the Lollards. Their historical significance aside, though, Wyclif’s works represent an important philosophical and theological achievement in their own right. This site intends to make Wyclif’s Latin corpus—now accessible only in the decaying late-19th-century editions of the defunct Wyclif Society—more widely available to a general scholarly audience.
